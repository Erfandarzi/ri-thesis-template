abstract = {The mapping and localization problems have received considerable attention in robotics recently. The exploration problem that drives mapping has started to generate similar attention, as the ease of construction and quality of map is strongly dependent on the strategy used to acquire sensor data for the map. Most exploration strategies concentrate on selecting the next best measurement to take, trading off information gathering for regular relocalization. What has not been studied so far is the effect the robot controller has on the map quality while executing exploration plans. Certain kinds of robot motion (e.g, sharp turns) are hard to estimate correctly, and increase the likelihood of errors in the mapping process. We show how reinforcement learning can be used to generate good motion control while executing a simple information gathering exploration strategy. We show that the learned policy reduces the overall map uncertainty by reducing the amount of uncertainty generated by robot motion},

@misc{Fox1998,
abstract = {Localization is the problem of determining the position of a mobile robot from sensor data. Most existing localization approaches are passive, i.e., they do not exploit the opportunity to control the robots effectors during localization. This paper proposes an active localization approach. The approach is based on Markov localization and provides rational criteria for (1) setting the robots motion direction (exploration), and (2) determining the pointing direction of the sensors so as to most efficiently localize the robot. Furthermore, it is able to deal with noisy sensors and approximative world models. The appropriateness of our approach is demonstrated empirically using a mobile robot in a structured office environment.},

@inproceedings{Makarenko2002,
abstract = {Integrated exploration strategy advocated in this paper refers to a tight coupling between the tasks of localization, mapping, and motion control and the effect of this. coupling on the overall effectiveness of an exploration strategy. Our approach to exploration calls for a balanced evaluation of alternative motion actions from the point of view of information gain, localization quality, and navigation cost. To provide a uniform basis of comparison of localization quality between different locations, a "localizability" metric is introduced. It is based on the estimate of the lowest vehicle pose covariance attainable from a given location.},

@inproceedings{Sim2005,
abstract = {It is well-known that the Kalman filter for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) converges to a fully correlated map in the limit of infinite time and data 1. However, the rate of convergence of the map has a strong dependence on the order of the observations. We show that conventional exploration algorithms for collecting map data are sub-optimal in both the objective function and choice of optimization procedure. We show that optimizing the a-optimal information measure results in a more accurate map than existing approaches, using a greedy, closed-loop strategy. Secondly, we demonstrate that by restricting the planning to an appropriate policy class, we can tractably find non-greedy, global planning trajectories that produce more accurate maps, explicitly planning to close loops even in open-loop scenarios.},
