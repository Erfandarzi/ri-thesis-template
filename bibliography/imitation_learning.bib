@techreport{Ross2014,
abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated that problems-- particularly imitation learning and structured prediction-- where a learner's predictions influence the input-distribution it is tested on can be naturally addressed by an interactive approach and analyzed using no-regret online learning. These approaches to imitation learning, however, neither require nor benefit from information about the cost of actions. We extend existing results in two directions: first, we develop an interactive imitation learning approach that leverages cost information; second, we extend the technique to address reinforcement learning. The results provide theoretical support to the commonly observed successes of online approximate policy iteration. Our approach suggests a broad new family of algorithms and provides a unifying view of existing techniques for imitation and reinforcement learning.},

@article{Crammer2002,
abstract = {In this paper we describe the algorithmic implementation of multiclass kernel-based vector machines. Our starting point is a generalized notion of the margin to multiclass problems. Using this notion we cast multiclass categorization problems as a constrained optimization problem with a quadratic objective function. Unlike most of previous approaches which typically decompose a multiclass problem into multiple independent binary classification tasks, our notion of margin yields a direct method for training multiclass predictors. By using the dual of the optimization problem we are able to incorporate kernels with a compact set of constraints and decompose the dual problem into multiple optimization problems of reduced size. We describe an efficient fixed-point algorithm for solving the reduced optimization problems and prove its convergence. We then discuss technical details that yield significant running time improvements for large datasets. Finally, we describe various experiments with our approach comparing it to previously studied kernel-based methods. Our experiments indicate that for multiclass problems we attain state-of-the-art accuracy.},

@inproceedings{Ng2000,
abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) in Markov decision processes, that is, the problem of extracting a reward function given observed, optimal behaviour. IRL may be useful for apprenticeship learning to acquire skilled behaviour, and for ascertaining the reward function being optimized by a natural system. We rst characterize the set of all reward functions for which a given policy is optimal. We then derive three algorithms for IRL. The rst two deal with the case where the entire policy is known; we handle tabulated reward functions on a nite state space and linear functional approximation of the reward function over a potentially in- nite state space. The third algorithm deals with the more realistic case in which the policy is known only through a nite set of observed trajectories. In all cases, a key issue is degeneracy|the existence of a large set of reward functions for which the observed policy is optimal. To remove...},
