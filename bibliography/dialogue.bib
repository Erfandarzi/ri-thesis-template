abstract = {This paper addresses the challenge of enabling non-expert users to command robots to perform complex high-level tasks using natural language. It describes an integrated system that combines the power of formal methods with the accessibility of natural language, providing correct-by-construction controllers for high-level specifications that can be implemented, and easy-to-understand feedback to the user on those that cannot be achieved. This is among the first works to close this feedback loop, enabling users to interact with the robot in order to identify a succinct cause of failure and obtain the desired controller. The supported language and logical capabilities are illustrated using examples involving a robot assistant in a hospital.},

@article{Golland2010,
abstract = {Language is sensitive to both semantic and pragmatic effects. To capture both effects, we model language use as a cooperative game between two players: a speaker, who gener- ates an utterance, and a listener, who responds with an action. Specifically, we consider the task of generating spatial references to ob- jects, wherein the listener must accurately identify an object described by the speaker. We show that a speaker model that acts op- timally with respect to an explicit, embedded listener model substantially outperforms one that is trained to directly generate spatial de- scriptions.},

@article{Deits2013,
abstract = {Our goal is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of natural language communication between humans and robots. Human language is frequently ambiguous, and a robot’s limited sensing makes complete understanding of a statement even more difficult. To address these challenges, we describe an approach for enabling a robot to engage in clarifying dialog with a human partner, just as a human might do in a similar situation. Given an unconstrained command from a human operator, the robot asks one or more questions and receives natural language answers from the human. We apply an information-theoretic approach to choosing questions for the robot to ask. Specifically, we choose the type and subject of questions in order to maximize the reduction in Shannon entropy of the robot’s mapping between language and entities in the world. Within the framework of the G3 graphical model, we derive a method to estimate this entropy reduction, choose the optimal question to ask, and merge the information gained from the human operator’s answer. We demonstrate that this improves the accuracy of command understanding over prior work while asking fewer questions as compared to baseline question-selection strategies.},
