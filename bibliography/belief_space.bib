abstract = {This paper investigates hindsight optimization as an approach for leveraging the significant advances in deterministic plan- ning for action selection in probabilistic domains. Hindsight optimization is an online technique that evaluates the one- step-reachable states by sampling future outcomes to gener- ate multiple non-stationary deterministic planning problems which can then be solved using search. Hindsight opti- mization has been successfully used in a number of online scheduling applications; however, it has not yet been con- sidered in the substantially different context of goal-based probabilistic planning. We describe an implementation of hindsight optimization for probabilistic planning based on de- terministic forward heuristic search and evaluate its perfor- mance on planning-competition benchmarks and other prob- abilistically interesting problems. The planner is able to out- perform a number of probabilistic planners including FF- Replan on many problems. Finally, we investigate conditions under which hindsight optimization is guaranteed to be ef- fective with respect to goal achievement, and also illustrate examples where the approach can go wrong.},

abstract = {We cast the partially observable control problem as a fully observable underactuated stochastic control problem in belief space and apply standard planning and control techniques. One of the difficulties of belief space planning is modeling the stochastic dynamics resulting from unknown future observations. The core of our proposal is to define deterministic beliefsystem dynamics based on an assumption that the maximum likelihood observation (calculated just prior to the observation) is always obtained. The stochastic effects of future observations are modelled as Gaussian noise. Given this model of the dynamics, two planning and control methods are applied. In the first, linear quadratic regulation (LQR) is applied to generate policies in the belief space. This approach is shown to be optimal for linear- Gaussian systems. In the second, a planner is used to find locally optimal plans in the belief space. We propose a replanning approach that is shown to converge to the belief space goal in a finite number of replanning steps. These approaches are characterized in the context of a simple nonlinear manipulation problem where a planar robot simultaneously locates and grasps an object.},

@inproceedings{Platt2012,
abstract = {We consider the partially observable control problem where it is potentially necessary to perform complex information-gathering operations in order to localize state. One approach to solving these problems is to create plans in belief-space, the space of probability distributions over the underlying state of the system. The belief-space plan encodes a strategy for performing a task while gaining information as necessary. Unlike most approaches in the literature which rely upon representing belief state as a Gaussian distribution, we have recently proposed an approach to non-Gaussian belief space planning based on solving a non-linear optimization problem defined in terms of a set of state samples. In this paper, we show that even though our approach makes optimistic assumptions about the content of future observations for planning purposes, that all low-cost plans are guaranteed to gain information in a specific way under certain conditions. We show that eventually, the algorithm is guaranteed to localize the true state of the system and to reach a goal region with high probability. Although the computational complexity of the algorithm is dominated by the number of samples used to define the optimization problem, our convergence guarantee holds with as few as two samples. Moreover, we show empirically that it is unnecessary to use large numbers of samples in order to obtain good performance.},
