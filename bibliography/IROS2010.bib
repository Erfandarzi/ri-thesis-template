@inproceedings{Ng2000,
abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of inverse  reinforcement learning (IRL) in Markov decision  processes, that is, the problem of extracting  a reward function given observed,  optimal behaviour. IRL may be useful for  apprenticeship learning to acquire skilled behaviour,  and for ascertaining the reward  function being optimized by a natural system.  We rst characterize the set of all reward  functions for which a given policy is  optimal. We then derive three algorithms  for IRL. The rst two deal with the case  where the entire policy is known; we handle  tabulated reward functions on a nite state  space and linear functional approximation of  the reward function over a potentially in-  nite state space. The third algorithm deals  with the more realistic case in which the policy  is known only through a nite set of observed  trajectories. In all cases, a key issue is  degeneracy|the existence of a large set of reward  functions for which the observed policy  is optimal. To remove...},
